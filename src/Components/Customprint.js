                            <p>The minimum order for our print screen and embroidery service is 12 bags. Customization can be applied to one or both sides, but you will have to double the quantity to reflect a double side application. For example, if you are ordering 60 bags and want print on both sides, you then need to choose a quantity of 120.</p>
